The use of intramuscular\nlorazepam is also permitted for emergent agitation, but only if deemed absolutely \nnecessary by the investigator. The following guide should be used to determine \napproximate lorazepam equivalents: 1 mg lorazepam; = 5 mg diazepam; = 15 mg \noxazepam; = 15 mg clorazepate. Subjects must not be on more than one benzodiazepine \nbeyond the screening visit.\nIf a subject is receiving 2 benzodiazepines at the screening visit (eg, lorazepam and \noxazepam), attempts should be made to discontinue one of the benzodiazepines, if \nclinically warranted, to allow potential subjects to enter the trial. The second \nbenzodiazepine should be tapered off over an appropriate amount of time within the \n45-day screening period to prevent side effects, and the subject should be maintained on \nthe remaining benzodiazepine for at least 14 days prior to the administration of Abilify \nMyCite. Benzodiazepine use is allowed during the trial to manage AEs such as agitation, \nanxiety, and insomnia; however, non-benzodiazepine sleep aids are recommended for \ninsomnia. Combined use of both drug classes (ie, benzodiazepines and non-\nbenzodiazepine sleep aids) as treatment for insomnia is not allowed. Benzodiazepine use \nshould be discontinued as soon as the AE for which it was initiated subsides, as per the \ninvestigator\u2019s discretion to avoid any withdrawal effects.\nMedications that are restricted during the trial are listed in Table 4.2-1.\n\n### Response:\n\nRegarding your question, the trial is monitoring drug interactions. Table 4.1-1 on page 65 and 66 lists examples of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers that are prohibited during the trial.

Each aripiprazole tablet is embedded with an IEM. When \nswallowed, and after reaching the stomach, the IEM transmits a signal that is detected \nand recorded by a patch worn on the subject\u2019s torso. The patch transmits data to the \nsubject\u2019s mobile device (ie, smartphone), which uploads data to a secure, cloud-based \nserver. Use of Abilify MyCite will allow subjects to view their aripiprazole ingestion data \non their mobile device; in this way, the subject can learn about their medication ingestion\n\n### Response:\n\nBased on the information provided in the PDF, there is no indication that the study is life-threatening. However, the study does involve monitoring adverse events and potential risks associated with the use of Abilify MyCite.

For purposes of this study, subjects \nwho complete Visit 3 will be defined as completers.\n3.8\nDefinition of Lost to Follow-up\nSubjects who cannot be contacted on or before Visit 3 and who do not have a known \nreason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew) will be classified as \u201clost to follow-up\u201d as the \nreason for discontinuation.\n3.9\nSubject Compliance\nA subject will be withdrawn from the study by the investigator (or designee) if the \nsubject is noncompliant with the protocol (defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the \nstudy schedule or procedures) and the details will be recorded on the appropriate eSource.\n3.10\nProtocol Deviations\nDeviations from the protocol are not allowed. A protocol deviation is any noncompliance \nwith the clinical study protocol, GCP, or sponsor\u2019s standard operating procedures. The \nnoncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the investigator (or designee), or \nthe site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site \nand implemented promptly.\n\n------------------------------\n\nPage:28\nText:\nProtocol 031-201-00469\n29\nConfidential - Proprietary Information\n22 Feb 2021\n\uf0b7\nSubject number\n\uf0b7\nClinical site number\n\uf0b7\nID of material (product/compound name, lot/batch number, serial number, \nshipment number, expiry date)\n\uf0b7\nClinical protocol reference (number and/or trial name)\n\uf0b7\nDosage form/strength (if known)\n\uf0b7\nPictures of complaint sample (if available)\n\uf0b7\nAvailability of complaint sample for return\n3.5.3.3\nReturn Process\nIndicate during the report of the PQC if the complaint sample is available for return. \nIf complaint sample is available but not at the clinical site, please instruct subject to bring \nthe complaint sample to their next site visit.\nIf complaint sample is available for return, the return instructions will be provided by the \nsponsor.\nIt must be documented in the site accountability record that the complaint sample has \nbeen forwarded to the sponsor for complaint investigation.\n3.5.3.4\nAssessment/Evaluation\nAssessment and evaluation of PQCs will be handled by the sponsor.\n3.5.4\nEnd-of-Study\nThe end-of-study date is defined as the last date of contact or the date of final contact \nattempt for the last subject completing or withdrawing from the study.\n3.6\nWithdrawal Criteria and Procedures\n3.6.1\nCompletion\nIf the sponsor terminates or suspends the study for safety or unanticipated other reasons, \nprompt notification will be given to investigators, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory authorities \nin accordance with regulatory requirements.\n3.6.2\nIndividual Site\nThe sponsor should be notified promptly if the study is terminated by the investigator or \nthe IBR/IEC at the site.\n\n------------------------------\n\nPage:38\nText:\nProtocol 031-201-00469\n39\nConfidential - Proprietary Information\n22 Feb 2021\n9\nAmendment Policy\nThe investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without the sponsor\u2019s prior \nwritten consent and subsequent approval by the IRB/IEC. Any permanent change to the \nprotocol, whether it be an overall change or a change for specific study site(s), must be \nhandled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment will be written by the sponsor. Each \namendment will be submitted to the IRB/IEC per applicable local regulations. Except for \n\u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201cnonsubstantial\u201d amendments, investigators will wait for IRB/IEC \napproval of the amended protocol before implementing the change(s). Administrative \namendments are defined as having no effect on the safety of subjects, the conduct or \nmanagement of the study, the study design or the quality or safety of the study. However, \na protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should \nbe implemented immediately, followed by IRB/IEC notification within 5 working days. \nThe sponsor will submit protocol amendments to regulatory agencies as required.\nWhen the IRB/IEC, investigators, and/or the sponsor conclude that the protocol \namendment substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the \nsubject, the currently approved written eICF will require similar modification. In such \ncases, repeat informed consent will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the study before \nexpecting continued participation.\n\n### Response:\n\nRegarding your question, I'm sorry but the pages you provided do not contain information about the packaging requirements for shipment of lab samples. However, the protocol does mention the ID of material (product/compound name, lot/batch number, serial number, shipment number, expiry date) and the availability of complaint sample for return [P29]. Additionally, the investigator or designee must record all PQCs identified through any means from the receipt of the RW2 patches and the MITs from the sponsor or sponsor\u2019s designee, through and including reconciliation and up to destruction, including subject dosing [P28]. Finally, the investigator or designated site personnel will maintain a log of all test articles dispensed and returned [P38].\n\n"}, {"text": "### Instruction: Given the Context of a Protocol PDF and a Query, Find relevant information from the context, and formulate an answer .

These data will be collected \ninto a system that is fully validated. Changes to the data will be captured by an automatic \naudit trail.\nThe study site will be given an electronic tablet to directly record subject data and clinical \nobservations on electronic forms. Designated study site staff will not be given access to \nthe system until they have been appropriately trained. Information to be originally \ncaptured and reviewed electronically shall include details of the subject visit and the \nprotocol required assessments performed. Because this study is using an electronic source \nrecord as the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry step for the \nstudy site for data collected directly into the app; rather, the electronic source record \ndirectly populates the study database.\nSome data may be captured via paper and then entered into the eSource system. These \nand any other data treated in this manner will be source data verified by the study clinical \nresearch associate, and the location of the source data (ie, eSource, paper, or a local \nelectronic system) will be documented before the study start. Any changes to information \nin paper source documents will be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a \nstudy site staff member authorized to make the change. Changes will be made by striking \na single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly \nentering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not \napparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation \nby the clinician.\nRemote monitoring of the original electronic source records will take place; however, \non-site monitoring inspections will continue to take place in order to review data entry of \nsource documentation directly captured on paper and transcribed into the system, to \nensure protocol adherence, to assess study site operational capabilities, and to perform \nother monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely.\nAt the end of the study, the investigator must certify that the data entered into the eSource \napp are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive an \nelectronic copy of the subject data.\n\n### Response:\n\nRegarding your question, the PDF does not explicitly state whether the data collection is happening at a lab or not. However, it does mention that during each subject's visit to the clinic, a clinician participating in the study will record progress notes to document all significant observations [P35].\n\n"}, {"text": "### Instruction: Given the Context of a Protocol PDF and a Query, Find relevant information from the context, and formulate an answer .
