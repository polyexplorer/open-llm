About this Website
About this Website
Thank you so much for visiting my website.
This website is not a business. It generates no revenues. I have made an enormous personal investment of time and energy in building it, motivated only by my love for the music. Before technology made it possible to share music in the form of digital information, Indian classical music was unknown to most of the world. Now that people can access any music they like from the comfort of their homes, the prospects for Indian classical music are brighter too. But there is another factor that still limits its popularity – its complexity, which makes it hard for those who are unfamiliar with it to really understand or relate to it. Through my website, I hope to make this music more accessible to everyone by demystifying it to some extent.
Please write to me at sadhana@raag\-hindustani.com if you would like to leave a comment or ask a question about the music or the site. I try to respond promptly when I can, but I hope you will forgive me for any delays. Sometimes family and work\-related commitments take precedence.
Apart from this site, I also have an account with Musescore (raaghindustani), to which I upload the contents of my website in downloadable sheet music format. My Youtube channel (Raag Hindustani) is a repository for the videos I use on this site to demonstate various concepts, but it also has several playlists of my favorite performances in Indian classical music and other genres. You can also follow and interact with me on Quora (Sadhana), where I answer questions about Indian classical music.
